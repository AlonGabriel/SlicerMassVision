SlicerDESI is a module developed in 3D Slicer platform for end-to-end analysis of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) data, particularly Desorption ElectroSpray Ionization (DESI) modality. The functionalities include data exploration via various targeted and non-targeted visualization, co-localization to spatial labels (histopathology annotations), dataset generation with spatial- and spectral-guidance, multi-slide data aggregation via feature alignment, denoising via spatial aggregation, machine learning model training, and whole-slide model deployment.
