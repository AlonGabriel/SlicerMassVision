Visualization
#######
Use the **Visualization** tab to visualize the imported MSI data. MassVIsion supports different targeted and untargeted visualization approaches. 

Targeted Visualizations
******
Single-ion heatmap
-----------
Under 'Targeted single-ion' select the m/z value of interest from the 'Ion Image' dropdown, or type the m/z value while on the list to find and select the ion. Select a heatmap option and push 'Visualize' to see the single-ion image on the viewer.

Multi-ion visualization
-----------
Under 'Targeted multi-ion' select multiple m/z values associated with different color channels using a similar instruction for single-ion. MassVision supports overlaying up to 7 ion images using distinct color scales. Push 'Visualize' to see the result in the viewer.

Untargeted Multivariate
*********
These approaches leverage all ions and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate color representations of the MSI data. The visualization is created by concatenating the first three principal components as the red, green, and blue channels of an RGB image. 

Global-contrast
-----------
Select 'Global Contrast (PCA)' to create a PCA visualization based on all the pixels in the MSI data.

Local-contrast
----------
Use this visualization to emphasize the local metabolomic changes by recalculating the PCA specifically for a spatial region of interest (ROI) defined by the user. 

Within the markups toolbar appears on top of the module, click on the dice icon to activate rectangular region selection

Use the mouse cursor on the PCA image and create a bounding box by left-click-and-drag. The dimensions of the box can be adjusted by dragging the dots on the boxâ€™s perimeter. Its location can be adjusted by clicking on the center dot and dragging the box. 

If you would like to edit, rename, or delete the bounding box, click the dropdown beside the dice icon and select your desired action. 

.. note::
    If you edit the ROI, you will be directed to the Markups module. Navigate back to the MassVision module by clicking the magnifying glass beside 'Modules', and search for MassVision, or use the green arrows beside the 'Modules' to go to previous modules.


After the region is specified, click on 'Local Contrast (PCA)' to see generate the visualization for the region. To apply the calculated local PCA to the whole image, check 'Extend to whole slide'.

.. tip::
    For all the visualizations, users can adjust the brightness and contrast of the image by selecting the 'Adjust Window/Level' icon |WinLevIcon| in the 3D Slicer toolbar at the top of the screen. You can adjust the contrast by left-click-and-drag on the image or by selecting a region on it.

Pixel Spectrum
******

To plot the mass spectra associated with specific pixels, users should first identify the pixels of interest by placing 'fiducials' at their locations on the viewer. Any visualization can be used for guiding the mass spectrum plot.

#. Click the "Create New Point List" icon |PointList| on the Markups Toolbar.
#. Click on the desired location on the image to place a fiducial (marker).
#. To add another fiducial, select the "Place a Control Point" icon |PlacePoint| and click on the desired location within the visualization.
#. There is no limit to the number of fiducials, allowing you to add as many as needed.
#. To delete or rename a fiducial, right-click on it to view available options.
#. Once you are satisfied with the list of markers, click "Spectrum Plot". A second viewer will display a plot for each selected pixel next to the visualization image.
