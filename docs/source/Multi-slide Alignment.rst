Multi-Slide Alignment 
=======

To align the features of multiple CSV datasets and merge them into a single multi-slide dataset, navigate to the **Multi-slide alignment** tab within the module.

#. Import as many CSV files as desired by clicking **Select** under "Import CSV datasets" section. A dialog box will appear allowing you to browse your local storage and select files. 
#. After adding all data, you see the names and locations in list. You can add more files by clicking the **Select** button again, or delete existing files by clicking on **Delete** in front of each item.
#. After satisfied with the list, click on **Align and save**. Specify a name and save location for the consolidated file. Once completed, the files information will appear in the dialog box detailing the number of slides, classes, and spectra per classes. 

.. important::
    Differentiation between slides/patients is based on the names of the individual CSV datasets. Therefore, each dataset name must be unique to ensure error-free slide tracking.
