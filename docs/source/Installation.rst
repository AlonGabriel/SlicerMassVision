.. note::
    SlicerDESI is hosted in 3D Slicer image computation platform. If you are new to 3D Slicer, we recommend that you begin by referencing some of the available resources on the `3D Slicer Documentation <https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Training>`_ page. Ensure that you have the latest version of 3D Slicer installed. You can download the most recent version of 3D Slicer `here <https://download.slicer.org>`_.

To being experimentation with SlicerDESI, the module must be imported to 3D Slicer from your local desktop.  

#. Open 3D Slicer. 
#. In the 'Modules' section of the toolbar, click the magnifying glass |ico3| and find 'Extension Wizard'. Open the module. 
#. Select 'Select Extension'.
#. In the file explorer that pops up, navigate to where youâ€™ve saved the folder SlicerDESI. Select the folder, for example: "c:/Users/Jade/Desktop/SlicerDESI".
#. In the popup, select 'Add selected module to search paths', then click 'Yes'. The extension will take some time to install. You may track the progress in the Python Interactor.
#. In the 'Modules' section of the toolbar, find SlicerDESI and open the module.
#. Go to 'Edit' -> 'Application Settings' and update "Default scene location" to the desired folder for saving results.

Alternatively:

#. Open 3D Slicer. In the task bar go to 'Edit' -> 'Application Settings'.
#. From the menu on the left, select Modules.
#. To the right of additional module paths select the arrow. |ico1|
#. Select 'Add'.
#. Select the file folder where you have saved SlicerDESI, for example: "c:\Users\Jade\Desktop\SlicerDESI" |ico2|
#. At the bottom of the window select 'Okay'.
#. 3D Slicer will restart.
#. Re-open 3D Slicer, beside 'Modules' in the toolbar, select the magnifying glass icon.
#. Search for SlicerDESI and switch to the module.
